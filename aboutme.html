                    Hello, my name is Conner Martinez. I'm a first-generation senior at National Louis university studying computer science with a concentration on web and app development. I was born and raised in Chicago Illinois to an immigrant father and a mother who didn't have much of a family, to begin with. growing up my parents were my most significant role models as they worked to the bone to give me the life they never had. They taught me hard work and self-respect, as well as never to look down on others and to never give up on myself or my dreams.

                I gained the idea of creating my reading and writing platform around the summer of 2022 after using multiple different kinds of apps similar to mine. I noticed many different problems with a lot of these apps, some being way too linear when it comes to the lack of creativity given to the user and their book, another being the fact that you have to pay a yearly subscription just to read the books. I want this app to be open to everyone who has a story that they want to share no matter how creative they want it to be. I want the website to be a safe place for everyone. I have so many ideas for the website that I plan on implementing in the future.
